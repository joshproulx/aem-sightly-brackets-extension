![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/adobe-marketing-cloud/aem-sightly-brackets-extension/screenshots/brackets_sightly_ext_sightly.png)

[Sightly](http://docs.adobe.com/content/docs/en/aem/6-0/develop/sightly.html "Sightly") is the new HTML templating system introduced with Adobe Experience Manager 6.0. The AEM Brackets Extension provides a smoother development workflow for writing AEM components, offering several features like:

* Sightly syntax-highlighting;
* code-completion for Sightly expressions, `data-sly-*` block elements and Use-API Java objects;
* bidirectional synchronisation.

## Requirements
The AEM Brackets Extension supports Brackets versions greater or equal than sprint 45. You can download a new Brackets version from [brackets.io](http://brackets.io "Brackets - The Free, Open Source Code Editor for the Web").

## How to Install the AEM Brackets Extension
1. Open Brackets. In menu **File**, select **Extension Manager…**
2. Enter `sightly`/`AEM` in the **search** bar and look for the `AEM Brackets Extension`.

3. Click **Install**.
4. Restart Brackets when asked.

## Working With the AEM Brackets Extension

#### The content-package project
After the extension has been installed, you can start developing AEM components by either opening a content-package folder from your file system with Brackets or by creating the structure for one from within the editor.

The project has to contain at least:
1. a `jcr_root` folder (e.g. `myproject/jcr_root`)
2. a `filter.xml` file (e.g. `myproject/META-INF/vault/filter.xml`); for more details about the structure of the `filter.xml` file please see the [Workspace Filter definition](http://jackrabbit.apache.org/filevault/filter.html "Apache Jackrabbit FileVault Documentation").

#### Synchronisation Settings
In order to synchronise your content to and from an AEM server you need to define your Synchronisation Settings. This can be done by going to **Sightly** > **Project Settings...** The menu entry can also be accessed through shortcuts: `⌘-Shift-P` on a Mac or `Ctrl-Shift-P` on a PC.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/adobe-marketing-cloud/aem-sightly-brackets-extension/screenshots/sync_settings.png)

The Synchronisation Settings allow you to configure:

1. the server URL (e.g. http://localhost:4502)
2. if you want to accept self-signed certificates for HTTPS hosts
3. the username used for synchronising content
4. the user's password

The settings will be saved in your project's root folder, in the .`brackets.json` file, e.g. `myproject/.brackets.json`. We don't recommend saving this file in your SCM system.

#### Synchronising Content

The AEM Sightly Brackets Extension provides two types of content synchronisation.

1. **Automated synchronisation for HTML, JavaScript, CSS and .content.xml files**; provided that the remote path of the files you are editing is allowed to be synchronised by the filtering rules defined in `filter.xml`, these files will be synced to the AEM server on-save; for `.content.xml` files their parent folders will be synchronised.
    
    ----
    **NOTE**
    Brackets has a list of predefined file extensions for the languages defined above:
    * **HTML**: html, htm, shtm, shtml, xhtml, cfm, cfml, cfc, dhtml, xht, tpl, twig, hbs, handlebars, kit, jsp, aspx, ascx, asp, master, cshtml, vbhtml
    * **JavaScript**: js, jsx, js.erb, jsm, _js
    * **CSS**: css, css.erb
    
    Therefore any documents matching Brackets' extension list for the above languages will get synchronised automatically on-save.

    ----
    
2. **On-demand bidirectional synchronisation**
    1. through the Project Explorer contextual menu entries - **Export to Server** or **Import from Server** - if the selected entry belongs to the `jcr_root` folder
    
        ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/adobe-marketing-cloud/aem-sightly-brackets-extension/screenshots/contextual_menu_sync.png)

        ----
        **NOTE**
        If the selected entry is a folder only the folder's content that's marked as included by the filtering rules from `filter.xml` will be synchronised.

        If the selected entry is outside of the `jcr_root` folder the **Export to Server** and **Import from Server** contextual menu entries are disabled.

        ----

    2. full content-package synchronisation through the Sightly top-level menu, by selecting either:
    
        * **Export Content Package** - `⌘-Shift-E` on a Mac, `Ctrl-Shift-E` on a PC
        * **Import Content Package** - `⌘-Shift-I` on a Mac, `Ctrl-Shift-I` on a PC

      ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/adobe-marketing-cloud/aem-sightly-brackets-extension/screenshots/export_content_package.png)

The AEM Brackets Extension adds a notification icon on the main toolbar, in the bottom right corner of the Brackets window. After a synchronisation operation is performed the notification icon's colour changes to indicate the synchronisation status:

* green - all files have been synchronised successfully
* yellow - some of the files were not synchronised successfully
* red - none of the selected files were synchronised
* blue - a sync operation is in progress

Hovering with your mouse cursor above the notification icon will make a tooltip appear with a summary of the last synchronisation operation.
 
Clicking on the notification icon will open the Synchronisation Status report dialog, offerring more detailed information about each file from the content tree you synchronised.

The AEM Brackets Extension also supports [.vltignore](http://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/cq/aem-how-tos/development/how-to-build-aem-projects-using-apache-maven.html#Adding Paths to the Package Without Syncing Them) files for excluding content from synchronising to and from the repository.

## Known Issues or Limitations
* Currently the AEM Brackets Extension does not support working with embedded content packages.
* `filter-vlt.xml` files are not yet taken into consideration.
* When synchronising a full content package only the `filter.xml` file from the `META-INF/vault` folder is used as the extension builds ad-hoc content packages that get installed and removed from your AEM instance; therefore your content package's definition is not altered but its content is updated.

## Sample Application
A sample application built with Brackets and the AEM Brackets Extension is available at [https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/aem-sightly-sample-todomvc](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/aem-sightly-sample-todomvc "Sightly TodoMVC Example").
